You can use the :resize (or :res) to change the height of the window.

To change the height to 60 rows, use:
:resize 60
You can also change the height in increments. 
To change the height by increments of 5, use:

:res +5
:res -5

You can use :vertical resize to change the width of the current window. 
To change the width to 80 columns, use:

:vertical resize 80
You can also change the width in increments. 
To change the width by increments of 5, use:

:vertical resize +5
:vertical resize -5

For a split window: 
Ctrl-w + and Ctrl-w - 
to resize the height of the current window by a single row


For a vsplit window: 
use Ctrl-w > and Ctrl-w < 
to resize the width of the current window by a single column. 

Additionally, these key combinations accept a count prefix so that you can change the window size in larger steps. 
[e.g. Ctrl-w 10 + increases the window size by 10 lines]

To resize all windows to equal dimensions based on their splits, you can use Ctrl-w =.

To increase a window to its maximum height, use Ctrl-w _.

To increase a window to its maximum width, use Ctrl-w |.

To resize in different steps, you can create maps that will adjust the window size differently. For example to increase the window size by a factor of 1.5 and decrease the window size by 0.67, you can map this:

nnoremap <silent> <Leader>+ :exe "resize " . (winheight(0) * 3/2)<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <Leader>- :exe "resize " . (winheight(0) * 2/3)<CR>

In Gvim and vim in terminals with mouse support, it is also possible to use the mouse to resize a window. Simply grab the statusline at the window border and drag it into the desired direction.
