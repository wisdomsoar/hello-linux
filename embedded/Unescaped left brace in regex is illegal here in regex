Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal here in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/\${ <-- HERE ([^ \t=:+{}]+)}/ at /home/dell/noobs/buildroot/output/host/usr/bin/automake line 3936. #470

Sol: 
As written by @Leobaillard you can use his patch. If you want to fix this with your editor (vi) you can go to line 3936 and make the following changes
$ vi buildroot/output/host/usr/bin/automake
goto line :3936 and change
$text =~ s/\${([^ \t=:+{}]+)}/substitute_ac_subst_variables_worker ($1)/ge;
to
$text =~ s/\$\{([^ \t=:+\{\}]+)\}/substitute_ac_subst_variables_worker ($1)/ge;
The error is with automake and perl v5.26.
In perl v5.22, using a literal { in a regular expression was deprecated, and will emit a warning if it isn't escaped: \{. In v5.26, this won't just warn, it'll cause a syntax error.
