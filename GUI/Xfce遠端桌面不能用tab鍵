Tab Key not working when using Xfce desktop
When using the Xfce desktop, users may notice that the tab key does not work. 
This is due to a bug in Xfce sending a super key modifier with the command

See Xfce bug 10760

To fix this,
Open the Xfce Application Menu (xfce4-settings-manager) > Settings > Window Manager
Click on the Keyboard Tab
Clear the Switch window for same application setting
