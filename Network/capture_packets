 tcpdump -i wlp0s20f0u1 -w test.cap -e -U ether proto 0x888e
 
 i: 指定Interface
 w: write to file (raw packets)
 -I: 使用Monitor mode (但無線網卡要有支援才行)
 -e: Print the link-level header on each dump line
 -U: 什麼意思 Make output saved via the -w option ''packet-buffered''; 
i.e., as each packet is saved, it will be written to the 
output file, rather than being written only when the output buffer fills.
 

ex:
tcpdump -i ra0 -w /tmp/ra0.cap 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null &
