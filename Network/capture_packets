ref: How to capture a Wi-Fi handshake in tcpdump

 tcpdump -i wlp0s20f0u1 -w test.cap -e -U ether proto 0x888e
 
-i: 指定Interface
-w: write to file (raw packets)
-I: 使用Monitor mode (但無線網卡要有支援才行)
-e: Print the link-level header on each dump line
-U: means immediately write packets when they are received. 
     Make output saved via the -w option ''packet-buffered''; 
     i.e., as each packet is saved, it will be written to the 
     output file, rather than being written only when the output buffer fills.

ex:
tcpdump -i ra0 -w /tmp/ra0.cap -U 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null &
