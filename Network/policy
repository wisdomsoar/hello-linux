遇到問某IP的MAC，卻回另外一介面的MAC
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_announce=1
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore=2 

arp_announce:
arp_announce - INTEGER
Define different restriction levels for announcing the local
source IP address from IP packets in ARP requests sent on
interface:
0 - (default) Use any local address, configured on any interface
1 - Try to avoid local addresses that are not in the target's
subnet for this interface. This mode is useful when target
hosts reachable via this interface require the source IP
address in ARP requests to be part of their logical network
configured on the receiving interface. When we generate the
request we will check all our subnets that include the
target IP and will preserve the source address if it is from
such subnet. If there is no such subnet we select source
address according to the rules for level 2.

arp_ignore:
Define different modes for sending replies in response to
received ARP requests that resolve local target IP addresses:
0 - (default): reply for any local target IP address, configured
on any interface
1 - reply only if the target IP address is local address
configured on the incoming interface
2 - reply only if the target IP address is local address
configured on the incoming interface and both with the
sender's IP address are part from same subnet on this interface
